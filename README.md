### Chrome extension for managing tasks

A simple chrome extension for managing your tasks at hand by saving links and texts. 

#### Features:
- Same links or texts if added more than once won't change the length of the list; the added item will simply appear at the list top
- Individual remove button for each added item
- Items added to the list is stored in the local storage and hence remain until the user manually clears the list
